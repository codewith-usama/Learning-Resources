Debugging in Android Apps


Using Log
- It is used to display system messages, such as when a garbage collection occurs, and messages that you added to your app with the Log class.

- It displays messages in real time and keeps a history so you can view older messages.


Logcat
- Same as log, just difference is that logcat always check the LOGS property that it is true or false before logging any message.
