XML in Android

 Resources are the additional files and static content and application needs, such as animation, color schemes, layouts, menu layouts.
 Each layout file must contain one (and only one!) root element

View
 It represents rectangular are of the screen, and is responsible for displaying information or content, and event handling.
 Text, images, and buttons are all views in Android.

ViewGroup
 It is essentially an invisible container that holds multiple Views or ViewGroup together, and defines their layout properties

Common View Groups

 A Grid View displays items in a two-dimensional scrollable grid
 A Table Layout group views into rows and column

Common View Groups
 A Linear Layout align its contents into a single direction, whether vertical or horizontal.
