As Data is spreading dy by data, we need someone who can understand, organize and processes this huge Data.

IOT and huge amount of Data produced by social media we need data science to handle this data

Data sciencist extract use full insight from your data and that can be used to grow your busniess

Walmart Use Case: They use their customer data and use it to grow their busniess. They uses data which
products trending and use it in sales

Data Science: Surfacing the hidden insights that can help company's to do smart bussniess and make
better decisions.
eg: Netflix and Youtube video suggestion

They investigate leads try to understand different patterns in order to find any useful insight.
 Maths, Technology (Sql, R, Python, SAAS) and Busniess

Skills Set Needs:
	Statics
	programming languages
	Data extraction (Extract and Storing Data)
	Data wrangling and exploration(Cleaning Data, NUll values and inconsistent values)
	Machine Learning
	Big Data processing frameworks(Data Driven problem solving)
	Data visualization

Job Roles
	Data Scientist (understand the problem of busniess and they have to offer the best solution)
	Data Analyst (Visualizing, processing huge amount of data, databases and optimization)
	Data Architect (Creates the blue print for data system)
	Data Engineer (Built and test big and scalable eco system, updating system)
	Statistician (logic, sql, and mining)
	Database Administrator (responsible for proper working of database, also responsible for database recovery and backups)
	Busniess Analyst(Busniess growth, understaing busniess)
	Data & Analyst Manager (Responsible for data science operation, assiging duties, management and social skills)


Data Life Cycle
	Busniess Requirment (Understanding the problems)
	Data Acquisition (Start gathering Data, how, where and store this Data)
	Data Processing (Cleaning, missing values, corrupted values and remove unnecessary values)
	Data exploration (Understand the pattern in Data, retrieve useful insight and visualization)
	Modelling (Spliting input data in traning and testing data set, build the model with traning
	dataset and evalute traning and testing dataset using series of macine learning and in
	last we will find a model suitable for our busniess)
	Deployment (Deploy in production or in production like enviroment)
