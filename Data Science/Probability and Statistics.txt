Statistics and probability forms the basics of Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms, AI and Data Science

Data? Data refers to facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

	Qualitative data (Qualitative data deals with characteristics and descriptors that can not be easily measured,
			 but can be observes subjectively)
	
		Nominal Data (Data with no ranking i.e Gender )
		Ordinal Data (Data with ordered series)
	
	Quantitative Data (Deals with numbers and things you can measure objectively)
		
		Discrete Data (finite number of possible values i.e number of students in class)
		Continous Data (hold infinite number of possible values i.e weight of a person)
Statistics? Is an area of applied maths concerned with data collecton, analysis, interpretation and presentation

Baic Terminologies in statistics: 
	Population (A collection or set of individuals or objects or events whose properties are to be analyzed) 
	Sample (A subset of population is called 'Sample'. A well chosen sample will contaon most of the tinformation
		abount a particular population parameter)

Sampling Techniques (Is a statical method that deals with the selection of individuals observation with in a population
			It's basically a short cut to studying the entire population)

	Probability Sampling (this sample from a large population are chosen from the probability theory)
		Random (Each member of the population has equal chance of being selected in the sample)
		Systematic (In systematic sampling every nth record is chosen from the populatin to be a part of the sample)
		Stratified (A stratum is a subset of the population that shares at least one common characteristic,
		in this case it's gender)

Types of Statistice:
	Descriptive (It uses the data to provide description of the population, either through numerical
	calculation or graphs or tables/Descriptive Statistics is mainly focused upon the main characteristics of data.
	It provides graphical summary of the Data)
	
	Inferential (It makes inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken
	from the population in question. Inferential statistics, generalizes a large dataset and
	applies probability to draw a conclusion. It allows us to infer data parameter based on
	a statistical model using a sample data.)

Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics is a method used to describe and understand the features of a specific data set
			by giving short summaries about the sample and measures of the data.

Measeres of Ventral tendency: includes mean(avg), median(middle value after arranging) and mod(most repeate value)
Measures of Variability(spread): range(max-min), inter Quartile range(divide in Quartile and take avg and then Q3 - Q1),
				 variance(Variance describes how much a random variable differ from its ecpected value)
				and std daviation(xi - mean) it is the difference between each element from the mean,
				Population variance and sample variacnce


Information Gain and Entropy: 
	Entropy:
		Entropy measures the impurity or uncertain present in the data
	IG:
		Information Gain indicates how much "Information" a particular
		feature/variable gives us about the final outcome
